# Interior-Shuffle


Welcome to the AI-Enhanced Interior Design Suite, where cutting-edge artificial intelligence meets modern interior design. Our platform leverages advanced machine learning to analyze your room's layout and offers intelligent suggestions for reshuffling existing furniture or incorporating new pieces seamlessly into your space.

## Features

- **Automated Furniture Detection**: Upload a photo of your room and let our AI detect and catalogue your furniture.
- **Intelligent Reshuffling**: Explore AI-recommended furniture arrangements that optimize your space.
- **Virtual Furniture Addition**: Visualize new furniture items in your room from a curated catalogue.
- **High-Resolution Output**: Receive high-quality images of your redesigned room layouts.

## Quick Start

1. **Set Up Your Environment**:
   Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed and the necessary libraries by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **API Keys**:
   Obtain and configure your API keys for OpenAI and any other used services as environment variables or in a `.env` file.

3. **Running the Application**:
   Start the web server by executing:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Uploading an Image**:

## Usage

- **Endpoint for Room Analysis**:
  POST `/analyze-room` with form-data containing the 'room_image'.
  
- **Endpoint for Furniture Reshuffling**:
  GET `/reshuffle` returns a visualization of your room with reshuffled furniture.

- **Endpoint for Adding New Furniture**:
  GET `/add-furniture` prompts you to select from a range of furniture before returning a visualization.

## Development

- **Expanding Furniture Catalogue**:
  Integrate with additional APIs or datasets to enhance the selection of available furniture.
